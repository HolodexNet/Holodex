    videoLinkageContent: >-
      All information is parsed from the video description. If you are clipping
      a stream, please make sure to link the official stream. If you are
      clipping fan made content (eg. from bilibili), just make sure to link the
      official youtube channels of relevant vtubers. If you do not link any
      vtuber channels, then we will not show that clip on holodex, as all clips
      require linkage to a vtuber known to holodex.

      title: How do I support Holodex?

        '0': >-
          Our self-hosted server is a 28-core 60GB RAM machine that take about
          $60 USD / mo to run, and we're looking to expanding more and more in
          our feature set, so we've started a <a
          href="https://ko-fi.com/holodex">Ko-fi</a> to cover Server costs. (We
          also have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/holodex">Patreon</a>, but
          we like the Ko-fi better.)<br /><br />You can also support Holodex by
          giving us feedback and supportive messages on twitter, helping us
          translate via <a href="https://crwd.in/holodex">Crowdin</a>, as well
          as contributing to our data store of songs. Even timing a stream for
          funny parts, and commenting that on the original stream is great help!

  VtuberRequirementText: >-
    A minimum of 20K subscribers is required for independents. Vtubers as part
    of existing orgs will be accepted. <br /><br />New Orgs will be created
    depending on the average subscriber count.
  ClipperRequirementText: >-
    For clippers, it must be at least 2 months old and post regularly, or post
    more than 20 clips in one month. Spamming of short clips every day, posting
    only short &lt;1min clips, or using unflattering thumbnails will all count
    against the channel. Content quality might be judged as well. <br /><br
    />It's important to note that clippers should cite their sources via channel
    links, @Youtube channel mentions, and video links. Overciting (e.g. Linking
    to everyone at Nijisanji) creates work for Holodex editors, and underciting
    (no links) will make clips hidden. <br /><br /> Holodex contains algorithms
    to detect overciting and correct them automatically, but it may not always
    work perfectly. Clippers who overcite may be removed from platform to reduce
    noise.
  DeletionRequirementText: >-
    Deletion should only be requested if you are the channel owner(s), please
    provide contact information so we can verify this.
