      devices (depends on device). Please give us feedback on discord if you
      have any idea how to produce a better playback system.
    videoLinkage: How do I make sure that videos are linked properly to vtubers?
    videoLinkageContent: >-
      All information is parsed from the video description. If you are clipping
      a stream, please make sure to link the official stream. If you are
      clipping fan made content (eg. from bilibili), just make sure to link the
      official youtube channels of relevant vtubers. If you do not link any
      vtuber channels, then we will not show that clip on holodex, as all clips
      require linkage to a vtuber known to holodex.
