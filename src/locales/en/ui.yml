      Please disable the browser security feature known as 3rd Party Cookies

    autoplayContent: Please google how to enable autoplay for your browser.
    musicPlayer: Music Player doesn't work well on Mobile Devices!
    musicPlayerContent: >-
      Sorry, but it's impossible to support Music Player as a website on mobile.
      <br/>Two factors: 1. Mobile devices usually forbid autoplay, which we
      require; 2. Mobile devices usually doesn't allow websites to chain up
      music in the background. 3. We don't integrate your queue into system
      level music control centers.
    videoLinkage: How do I make sure that videos are linked properly to vtubers?
    videoLinkageContent: >-
      All information is parsed from the video description. If you are clipping
      a stream, please make sure to link the official stream. If you are
      clipping fan made content (eg. from bilibili), just make sure to link the
      official youtube channels of relevant vtubers. If you do not link any
      vtuber channels, then we will not show that clip on holodex, as all clips
      require linkage to a vtuber known to holodex.
